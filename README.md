<h1 align="center">Hiruki</h1>
<p>
    Hiruki is a 3D renderer and game engine, written in C++. The primary focus of this project is self-learning in the field of computer graphics and related algebra, along with creating and mantaining a comprehensive, useful library.
</p> 

<p>
    Hiruki uses software rendering, meaning it does not use any graphics engines nor make use of the GPU. It only uses SDL2 to manually render each pixel in the screen.
